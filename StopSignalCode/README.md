Many thanks to Gui Xue for this code.

*1. Testing on your computer*

Test that the signal plays
```
test_sound.m
```
Test that the screen works
```
TestScreen.m
```
Then test that the voice key works
```
test_voicekey.m
```

*2. Behavioural version:*

Start by running the demo version
The options are
A. manual (T/D); 2. vocal (T/D), 3. word (pseudoword lists)
```
demo.m
```
Then run the main task
The options are
A. manual (T/D); 2. vocal (T/D), 3. word (pseudoword lists)
B. use 1 for the jitter question (use 2 if you want to use preset jitter)
```
prescan_stop3cond.m
```

3. Analysis
Enter the subject code followed by the condition.

```
Analysis.m
```
